# Formula 1 Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a university machine learning assignment based on a real-world
Formula 1 dataset. The main goal is to demonstrate understanding of fundamental
machine learning algorithms by implementing them from scratch and comparing
their performance with a standard library-based model.

## 📊 Dataset
**Source:** Kaggle  
**Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020  

The dataset contains historical Formula 1 data from 1950 to 2020, including
information about races, drivers, race results, and race metadata.
It consists of multiple structured CSV files with thousands of records,
making it suitable for regression and classification tasks.
